What I need
===========
1. My project is not very complex. It's essentially calling other scripts and playing around with the output a bit. The difficulty is that I would like to write this script with Python, but I have never ever written Python. So I what I need is someone with a lot of patience who is willing to essentially tutor me in Python.

2. My script also requires calling some fMRI tools. I do not do fMRI research so I do not know what those tools are. The second thing I need is someone with fMRI experience who would be willing to help me. An advantage would be someone who has experience using both fMRI and DWI, but it's not a requirement.


I can help with
===============
Diffusion-weighted imaging (preprocessing, tractography, analysis), anatomy, neuroscience.
